            <p>One of my favorite parts of golf is watching tournaments.
I like seeing how professionals handle the same challenges I face on 
the course, only with so much more control and focus. Golf tournaments
show just how mental the sport is, as players can be tied for hours,
and one bad swing or missed putt can change everything. My favorite 
is the Ryder Cup because it’s different from the others. 
Instead of players competing for themselves, it’s about playing 
your team and country. The energy feels higher, and every shot matters
not just for one person, but for everyone on the team. I also like the
team formats like foursomes and four-ball because they make 
more important. You see players adjusting their game to fit with their 
partner’s strengths. The crowds are louder, the celebrations are bigger, 
and the pressure feels more real. Watching the Ryder Cup makes me 
appreciate how golf can be both an individual and a team sport at 
the same time. It’s one of the few times in golf where emotion takes 
over, and I think that’s what makes it so exciting to watch.</p>
